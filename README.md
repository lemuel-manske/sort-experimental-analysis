# Experimental Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

This repository intends to study sorting algorithms by executing an experimental analysis.

To regenerate results, execute:

```bash
chmod +x ./compute.sh && ./compute.sh
```

Results are kept under `./results/` folder.

The final paper LaTeX code can be view under `./paper`.

Finally, analysis results are generated on `./analysis.ipynb`.
