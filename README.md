# Experimental Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

This repository intends to study sorting algorithms by executing an experimental analysis.

To regenerate results, execute:

```bash
chmod +x ./compute.sh && ./compute.sh
```

Results are kept under [results](./results) folder.

The final paper LaTeX code can be view under [paper](./paper) folder.

Finally, analysis results are generated on [analysis.ipynb](./analysis.ipynb) file.
